  This research paper explores the process of emulating the vocal style of the legendary Indian playback singer SP Balasubrahmanyam using a language model (LLM). The study involves collecting datasets on SP Balasubrahmanyam's career and vocal performances, training an LLM to generate songs based on his unique vocal characteristics, and analyzing the results. The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in capturing and replicating the vocal essence of iconic singers.
